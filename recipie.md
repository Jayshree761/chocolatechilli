Steps
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for a few minutes until it has softened, then add the turkey and cook until no trace of pink remains, stirring to break up any clumps as it cooks. Carefully drain and discard the fat from the skillet. (It will be hot, so a parent should do this.)
Add the cocoa powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, allspice, cinnamon, the tomatoes and their juice, tomato paste and water. Stir to combine. Cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring a few times.

Increase the heat to medium-high; once the mixture starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low. Stir in the chocolate and beans. Cook for 30 minutes, sitrring a few times.

You can taste and adjust the seasoning as you like.
